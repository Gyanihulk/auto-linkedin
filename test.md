| Feature                | WebGL                                           | React Three Fiber                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Level of Abstraction** | Low-level graphics API                          | High-level, built on top of Three.js          |
| **Ease of Use**        | Requires deep understanding of graphics programming | More beginner-friendly, declarative approach  |
| **Control**            | Full control over rendering pipeline             | Less direct control, abstracted by React API  |
| **Performance**        | Highly optimized, low-level operations           | May introduce some overhead due to abstraction|
| **Integration**        | Standalone API                                   | Integrates easily with React applications     |
| **Development Speed**  | Slower, more effort required                     | Faster, leveraging React component architecture |
| **Community Support**  | Large, with broad graphics-focused resources     | Growing, supported by the React community     |
| **Learning Curve**     | Steep, requires learning GLSL for shaders        | Shallower, especially for React developers    |
| **Flexibility**        | Highly flexible, can create any graphics effect  | Limited by Three.js capabilities              |
| **Use Cases**          | Suitable for custom engines or graphics-heavy apps | Suitable for general 3D apps and prototyping  |
